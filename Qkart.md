Qkart â€“ Multi-Vendor E-commerce Platform
Qkart is a Laravel-powered multi-vendor e-commerce platform designed to empower local shopkeepers by giving them access to both local and international customers. The platform enables vendors to sell their products online with ease while offering customers same-day delivery and better prices than major marketplaces.

Key Backend Contributions (Laravel):

    Multi-Vendor Architecture: Designed and maintained a robust backend structure to support multiple independent vendor accounts, each with their own product listings, orders, and analytics.

    API Development: Developed and enhanced RESTful APIs for both web (React) and mobile (React Native) clients, ensuring smooth communication and data synchronization.

    Custom Routes: Added new Laravel routes and controllers specifically for customer website support, extending existing logic to serve both the new frontend and previous mobile architecture.

    Order & Inventory Management: Implemented and optimized core functionalities for order processing, real-time inventory updates, and delivery tracking.

    Payment Integration: Integrated secure payment gateways and handled transaction logic to support a seamless checkout experience.

    Code Refactoring: Refactored legacy code to improve performance, scalability, and maintainability while ensuring backward compatibility.

    Vendor & Customer Modules: Built modular components for user management, allowing easy onboarding of vendors and smooth user flow for customers.
