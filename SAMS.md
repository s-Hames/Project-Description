# SAMS - Student Academic Management Software

In response to the growing complexity of educational operations, this project introduces a powerful, user-friendly, and cross-platform application tailored for institutions, mentors, nodal officers, and state officials. The platform centralizes and streamlines critical tasks like school management, student progress tracking, and equipment utilization.

Key Functional Areas:

    School Management: Tracks the progress and participation of schools with installed educational labs.

    Student Progress Monitoring: Maintains comprehensive records of academic performance, attendance, and mentoring support.

    Equipment Utilization: Logs and analyzes how educational equipment is used across institutions.

    Mentor & Officer Reporting: Mentors record session details, equipment used, and attach YouTube session links. Nodal officers and state officials review data for compliance and performance evaluation.

Core Contributions:

    Flutter App Development: Built an intuitive Flutter-based mobile app tailored for mentors and state officials to log visits, input session data, and manage school interactions.

    Date-Wise Tracking Feature: Integrated a chronological tracking mechanism, allowing users to filter and manage entries by specific datesâ€”improving usability and data organization.

    Admin Interface: Created an admin panel within the app to view, monitor, and validate all entries, enabling centralized oversight and quick decision-making.

    Firebase Integration: Used Firebase as the backend solution for real-time data storage, user authentication, and instant updates across users and roles.

    Access Control & Role Management: Designed role-based access so mentors, nodal officers, and state-level users have appropriate visibility and control over their areas of responsibility.

Impact:
This system brings modern infrastructure to educational institutions, enabling real-time visibility, improved accountability, and data-driven decision-making at every administrative level. With cross-platform accessibility and scalability in mind, it sets the foundation for future expansions and smarter educational management.
