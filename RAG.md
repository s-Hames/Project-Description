# RAG â€“ Intelligent Information Retrieval and Insight Generation Platform

This project leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) principles to build an intelligent system that enhances user interaction and access to information through natural language.

Core Contributions:

    Python + Gemini Integration: Developed a robust backend using Python and integrated with Googleâ€™s Gemini to enable context-aware interactions, allowing users to retrieve accurate information and receive personalized, intelligent insights.

    React-Based Frontend: Built a responsive and interactive frontend using React, providing users with a smooth and intuitive experience for querying and exploring information.

    Personal Home Server Deployment: Utilized a self-hosted backend server to handle computationally intensive tasks, ensuring efficient management of resources and secure processing of user inputs.

    Vercel Hosting: Deployed the frontend on Vercel for fast, reliable, and scalable access, ensuring quick load times and continuous deployment support.

Impact:
This project combines the power of AI-driven information retrieval with user-friendly design, offering a smart solution for individuals or organizations looking to harness contextual knowledge and dynamic insights.
